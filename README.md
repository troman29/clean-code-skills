**Teach your AI to write code that doesn't suck.**

This repository contains [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) that enforce Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code* principles. They work with Google Antigravity, Anthropic's Claude Code, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.

## Why?

AI generates code fast, but research shows it also generates technical debt fast:

- **GitClear**: 4x increase in code duplication with AI adoption
- **Carnegie Mellon**: +30% static analysis warnings, +41% code complexity after Cursor adoption
- **Google DORA**: Negative relationship between AI adoption and software delivery stability

These skills encode battle-tested solutions to exactly these problems—directly into your AI workflow.

## What's Included

| Track | Skill | Description | Rules |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Python | `boy-scout` | **Orchestrator**—always leave code cleaner than you found it | Coordinates all skills |
| Python | `python-clean-code` | **Master skill** with all 66 rules | C1-C5, E1-E2, F1-F4, G1-G36, N1-N7, P1-P3, T1-T9 |
| Python | `clean-comments` | Minimal, accurate commenting | C1-C5 |
| Python | `clean-functions` | Small, focused, obvious functions | F1-F4 |
| Python | `clean-general` | Core principles (DRY, single responsibility) | G5, G16, G23, G25, G30, G36 |
| Python | `clean-names` | Descriptive, unambiguous naming | N1-N7 |
| Python | `clean-tests` | Fast, thorough, boundary-aware tests | T1-T9 |
| TypeScript | `boy-scout` | **Orchestrator**—always leave code cleaner than you found it | Coordinates all skills |
| TypeScript | `typescript-clean-code` | **Master skill** with all 66 rules | C1-C5, E1-E2, F1-F4, G1-G36, N1-N7, TS1-TS3, T1-T9 |
| TypeScript | `clean-comments` | Minimal, accurate commenting | C1-C5 |
| TypeScript | `clean-functions` | Small, focused, obvious functions | F1-F4 |
| TypeScript | `clean-general` | Core principles (DRY, single responsibility) | G5, G16, G23, G25, G30, G36 |
| TypeScript | `clean-names` | Descriptive, unambiguous naming | N1-N7 |
| TypeScript | `clean-tests` | Fast, thorough, boundary-aware tests | T1-T9 |

Use the master skill for comprehensive coverage, or individual skills for targeted enforcement.

### Choose Your Language

Pick one track and copy only that track's skills:

> [!WARNING]
> Both tracks can share one skills directory: every skill is prefixed with its language, so nothing collides. The cost is context — an agent carries the description of every installed skill at all times, so both tracks mean 14 descriptions instead of 7. Install one track if you only work in one language.

```bash
# Python track
cp -r skills/python-* <YOUR_SKILLS_DIR>/

# TypeScript track
cp -r skills/typescript-* <YOUR_SKILLS_DIR>/
```

### The Boy Scout Rule

The `boy-scout` skill embodies Clean Code's core philosophy:

> "Always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out."

You don't have to make code perfect—just **a little bit better** with every touch. The `boy-scout` skill orchestrates the others, ensuring every code interaction leaves a trail of small improvements.

---

## Installation

Copy a track into any skills directory (`.agent/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, etc.). Both tracks may live side by side — the language prefix keeps them apart.

### Google Antigravity

**Project-specific** (applies to one project):

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p .agent/skills
# Python track
cp -r skills/python-* .agent/skills/

# TypeScript track
cp -r skills/typescript-* .agent/skills/
```

**Global** (applies to all projects):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills
# Python track
cp -r skills/python-* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/

# TypeScript track
cp -r skills/typescript-* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/
```

**Quick install** (global, one command) — pick one track:

```bash
# Python track
git clone https://github.com/ertugrul-dmr/clean-code-skills.git /tmp/clean-code-skills && \
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && \
cp -r /tmp/clean-code-skills/skills/python-* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/ && \
rm -rf /tmp/clean-code-skills
```

```bash
# TypeScript track
git clone https://github.com/ertugrul-dmr/clean-code-skills.git /tmp/clean-code-skills && \
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && \
cp -r /tmp/clean-code-skills/skills/typescript-* ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/ && \
rm -rf /tmp/clean-code-skills
```

### Anthropic Claude Code

**Project-specific**:

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p .claude/skills
# Python track
cp -r skills/python-* .claude/skills/

# TypeScript track
cp -r skills/typescript-* .claude/skills/
```

**Global**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
# Python track
cp -r skills/python-* ~/.claude/skills/

# TypeScript track
cp -r skills/typescript-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Quick install** (global, one command) — pick one track:

```bash
# Python track
git clone https://github.com/ertugrul-dmr/clean-code-skills.git /tmp/clean-code-skills && \
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && \
cp -r /tmp/clean-code-skills/skills/python-* ~/.claude/skills/ && \
rm -rf /tmp/clean-code-skills
```

```bash
# TypeScript track
git clone https://github.com/ertugrul-dmr/clean-code-skills.git /tmp/clean-code-skills && \
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && \
cp -r /tmp/clean-code-skills/skills/typescript-* ~/.claude/skills/ && \
rm -rf /tmp/clean-code-skills
```

**Verify**

In a running Claude Code session, confirm the skills loaded:

- Ask `What skills are available?` — you should see `boy-scout`, `clean-comments`, `clean-functions`, `clean-general`, `clean-names`, `clean-tests`, and `python-clean-code` in the list.
- Or direct-invoke one: `/boy-scout` should load the Boy Scout skill explicitly.

Skills hot-reload inside an existing `~/.claude/skills/` directory — no restart needed. If you created the directory for the first time during this session, restart Claude Code once so it starts watching it.

**Update**

Re-run the Quick install command to pull the latest version. It overwrites the seven skill directories and leaves any other skills untouched.

If you expect to update often, symlink instead of copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ertugrul-dmr/clean-code-skills.git ~/src/clean-code-skills
# Pick a track — swap `python-*` for `typescript-*`, or use `*/` to link both.
cd ~/src/clean-code-skills/skills
for d in python-*/; do ln -sfn "$PWD/${d%/}" "$HOME/.claude/skills/${d%/}"; done
```

Then `git pull` in `~/src/clean-code-skills` refreshes every skill.

**Uninstall**

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/{boy-scout,clean-comments,clean-functions,clean-general,clean-names,clean-tests,python-clean-code}
```

### Other Agent Skills-Compatible Tools

The skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Check your tool's documentation for the skills directory location, then copy the `skills/` folder contents there.

## Usage

Once installed, skills activate automatically based on context. Ask your agent to:

- **Write code**: "Create a user authentication module" → Skills enforce clean patterns
- **Review code**: "Review this function for issues" → Agent identifies violations by rule number
- **Refactor**: "Refactor this to be cleaner" → Agent applies all relevant rules

### Example

**Before** (10 violations):

```python
from utils import *  # P1

# Author: John, Modified: 2024-01-15  # C1
def proc(d, t, flag=False):  # N1, F1, F3
    # Process the data  # C3
    x = []  # N1
    for i in d:
        if flag:  # F3
            if i['type'] == 'A':  # G23
                x.append(i['val'] * 1.0825)  # G25
            elif i['type'] == 'B':
                x.append(i['val'] * 1.05)  # G25
        else:
            x.append(i['val'])
    return x
```

**After** (with skills active):

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Literal

TAX_RATE_CA = 0.0825
TAX_RATE_NY = 0.05
TransactionType = Literal['CA', 'NY']

@dataclass
class Transaction:
    value: float
    type: TransactionType

def apply_tax(transaction: Transaction) -> float:
    """Apply state-specific tax to transaction value."""
    tax_rates = {'CA': TAX_RATE_CA, 'NY': TAX_RATE_NY}
    return transaction.value * (1 + tax_rates[transaction.type])

def process_transactions_with_tax(transactions: list[Transaction]) -> list[float]:
    """Calculate taxed values for all transactions."""
    return [apply_tax(t) for t in transactions]

def process_transactions_without_tax(transactions: list[Transaction]) -> list[float]:
    """Extract raw values from all transactions."""
    return [t.value for t in transactions]
```

**After (TypeScript track)**:

```ts
type TransactionType = "CA" | "NY"

const TAX_RATE_CA = 0.0825
const TAX_RATE_NY = 0.05

type Transaction = {
  value: number
  type: TransactionType
}

function applyTax(transaction: Transaction): number {
  const taxRates: Record<TransactionType, number> = {
    CA: TAX_RATE_CA,
    NY: TAX_RATE_NY,
  }
  return transaction.value * (1 + taxRates[transaction.type])
}

function processTransactionsWithTax(transactions: Transaction[]): number[] {
  return transactions.map(applyTax)
}

function processTransactionsWithoutTax(transactions: Transaction[]): number[] {
  return transactions.map((transaction) => transaction.value)
}
```

## Customization

### Using Individual Skills

Don't need all 66 rules? Copy only the skills you want:

```bash
# Just function rules
cp -r skills/python-clean-functions ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/

# Just comment rules  
cp -r skills/typescript-clean-comments ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Extending Skills

Add your own rules by editing the `SKILL.md` files or creating new skill folders:

```
skills/
├── python/
│   ├── python-clean-code/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── clean-comments/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── typescript/
│   ├── typescript-clean-code/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── clean-comments/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── my-team-standards/      # Your custom skill
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Adding Enforcement Scripts (Optional)

This repository does not ship a `scripts/` folder or lint scripts by default.
If you want stricter enforcement, create your own scripts inside the skill folder.

```
skills/python-python-clean-code/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── lint.py
```

## How Skills Work

Skills use **Progressive Disclosure**:

1. **Discovery**: Agent sees only skill names and descriptions
2. **Activation**: When your request matches a description, full instructions load
3. **Execution**: Scripts and templates load only when needed

This keeps the agent fast—it's not thinking about database migrations when you're writing a React component.
